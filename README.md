# Project Overview
Kate has this idea of creating a Bike Sharing business in her hometown of Des Moinres as she experienced in New York City. She has a potential investor, and she needs to build a proposal on actual data from the New York Citi Bike dataset to analyse and prove the feasibility.

## Task at Hand
1.  Use Jupyter Notebook to change the Trip Duration field to the Datetime format.
2.  Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
3.  Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Resources
1.  New York Citi Bike dataset - 201908-citibike-tripdata-new.csv
2.  Jupyter Notebook, GitHub and Tableau

# Results

### Below is the link to the Tableau Story:

### Following are the visualizations:

![Checkout_Times_for_Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805487-de538c80-c513-11eb-8a5d-e18c3292152b.png)

Overall, the length of trip duration ranges from 0 to about 40 minutes with the highest number of trips taking about 5 minutes. A more detailed view can be obtained by selecting any specific hour or hours in the day.

![Checkout_Times_for_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805499-e14e7d00-c513-11eb-8b52-eaef109363b3.png)

As can be seen, Male riders dominate the ridership. So, it is very important to know the breakdown of gender in a new location and, also try to make sure the gender information is filled in to get the unknown reduced further.



![Trips_by_Weekday_per_Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805537-ec091200-c513-11eb-805c-0fbe185c4945.png)

This heat map provides an excellent analysis of which days and the hours in the days when bike usage is at its highest and lowest. On the weekends and especially Saturdays, from 8AM to 8PM has a continuous flow of riders. On weekdays, the usage is more concentrated to 6AM to 9AM and then from 4PM to 8PM.  



![Trips_by_Gender_Weekday_per_Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805561-ef040280-c513-11eb-8d24-f1e9a82c9791.png)

This heat map shows similar breakdown in terms of trips for each day and per hour as the previous map. However, this is further divided to re-emphasise that a very high percentage of riders are male.  



![User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805581-f3c8b680-c513-11eb-8824-3c64af38b2d4.png)

This heat map brings forth a very important point and that is: Riders that are Subscribers to the program are more likely to participate. So, for this type of business it would help to somehow get as many people as possible subscribing.  



![Average_Trip_Duration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805612-fcb98800-c513-11eb-914b-df7fb45a7c39.png)

Even though the youngest riders have a higher average trip duration, the overall average is fairly constant for up to at least 50 years old. At any new location it would be helpful to know the population average age to make sure there is a significant population in this age range.  



![BIke_Maintenance_Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78666055/120805641-03e09600-c514-11eb-94a1-28a84b7c644f.png)

The Bike Maintenance Dashboard was included to show the bike utilisation and the number of trips for each bike to build the repairs and maintenance schedule. The low usage time from previous charts can be the maintenance window.  



# Summary
The visualizations show that it would be beneficial to get as many subscribers as possible to the program as they use it more than others. A study of the population as it relates to gender and age may be helpful as it shows young riders take longer trips and a very high percentage of riders are male.
Since most trips occur during work commute and on weekends it would definitely help to setup routes that are in the path of business places.

### Suggestion of additional analysis that would be helpful:
1.  Include more data so that month over month and year over year can be compared, especially to trend as season changes.
2.  Include weather data to see how a rain, snow or very hot/cold temperatures affects usage.
